# GitHub Mood Ring

🌈 **A fun, interactive way to visualize your GitHub activity as a colorful “mood ring.”**  

---

## **Why This Was Created**

The GitHub Mood Ring was built to **make GitHub profiles more personal, playful, and shareable**.  

- I wanted to create something **anyone could embed or share**, turning everyday contributions into a visual, fun, and dynamic representation.  
- The goal is to **encourage developers to see their work in a new light**, and give them a creative way to **show off their GitHub “vibe”**.  
- It’s inspired by whimsical internet culture, meme references, and the excitement of seeing your own avatar right in the middle of a mood ring.

## **How It Works**

1. Enter your GitHub username.  
2. The Mood Ring calculates your activity score based on recent GitHub events:  
   - **Push Events** → 3 points  
   - **Pull Requests** → 5 points  
   - **Issues** → 2 points  
3. A colorful ring is drawn, with your **profile picture in the center**.  
4. Random fun events may appear, like 🪳 (Alaskan Bull Worm) for extra silliness.
